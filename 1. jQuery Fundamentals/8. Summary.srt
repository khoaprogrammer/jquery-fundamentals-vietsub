00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In this module you've seen an overview of what jQuery is and what it offers; we know it's a very good cross-

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
browser JavaScript library; you can go to jquery.com to get it, and there's different versions you can grab

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
based on which browsers you want to support. Now, once you have jQuery we can add it into the page, and

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
then I showed how we can use things like document ready to detect when the DOM is loaded, and then we can

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
manipulate DOM elements like I showed with the jQuery HTML function. The other thing I showed at the end

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
was the jQuery Documentation, and I want to emphasize again how important it is to at least feel comfortable

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
navigating through that Documentation to find things, because it'll really speed up and make you a more

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
productive developer by learning it. So now that we've talked about the fundamentals of jQuery, it's time

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to jump in to some more fun with it. In the next module, we're going to talk about jQuery Selectors, and

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
how we can use Selectors to find DOM elements.
