1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Once you've loaded jQuery into a page, either with a local copy, or by calling out to a CDN, you can then

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
take it up a notch and start to use jQuery of course, and that's, after all, what we're after.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So in this section we're going to talk briefly about a little function jQuery provides, which is very, very

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
useful, and one that you'll find yourself using a lot called ready.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now, one of the important things to understand with jQuery is that when it's loaded, the window object, as

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
mentioned earlier, has a little property on it called jQuery. Now you can use that object directly or you

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
can use an alias of it, which is simply the dollar. And so notice here, I have $(document), and what we're

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
doing is passing the document object from the browser into jQuery, and then we're going to call the jQuery

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
ready function. Now, this doesn't wait until everything's loaded, and what I mean by that is with things

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
like window onload in JavaScript, it's not called until everything's loaded; images, CSS, and all of those

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
types of files. With the document ready, it detects once the DOM hierarchy has been loaded, so before all

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
the images and CSS have been loaded. And that allows you to start manipulating the DOM, and that could

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
include things like I want to show or hide, or add different things into the DOM; I can do that right when

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
the DOM's ready; I don't have to wait for all the images to download and things like that.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now, all we have to do is say $(document), and then notice we're passing that in to this little jQuery

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
function, so again the dollar here, you're going to see over and over and over throughout the class, and

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
it's simply an alias for the word jQuery. Now if you prefer to type the word jQuery you could do that too.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now, myself and many others out there, we just prefer to go with the dollar because it works and saves a

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
little bit of typing. So we're going to pass the document in that wraps it with a special jQuery wrapper.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now we can get to jQuery functionality and know when the document is ready.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now when it is ready, what do you want to do? Well you have to give jQuery your own custom functions, and

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
notice we have an in line anonymous function here, and this is where you perform the action that you should

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
be doing. So we could be adding things to the DOM, we could maybe trigger an AJAX call to go get some data

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
from the server, there's a lot of different things we could do. So let's take a look at the document ready

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and how we can use it in a live web page, and see when it's called and compare it to the window onload.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Now that jQuery's available in this simple page here, let's take a look at the difference between window

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:01,000
onload, and the document ready that jQuery provides. So I'm going to add our script tag in, and we'll go

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
ahead and add our type just to be official here, and then we'll add our closing.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now what I'm going to do first is kind of the standard JavaScript way to detect a load that you'll see out

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
there a lot. Now there's multiple ways to do this, but this is what I see a lot of people doing.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So we're going to say window.onload, and we're going to call our own custom function here, and then in this

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
function we're just going to do a simple alert, just to say hey, the window loaded.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So we'll say alert(‘Window loaded'). Alright, now that's kind of the standard way to do it, so let me save

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
that, we'll run off to the browser here, refresh, and you can see when the loader was called.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Alright, so nothing real fancy at this point. Well, we can also come in and do it the jQuery way.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So I'm going to come in, in fact, let me just put it after to kind of prove the fact that timing will be

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
faster when it comes to using jQuery. So because jQuery's already loaded, we could either do this:

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
jQuery(document), and then we could do our ready; or I can simply replace the keyword jQuery with $.

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And in all the demos I'll be doing throughout this course, I'll be using the alias of $; it provides a

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
little bit of a shortcut, don't have to type as much. So we're going to pass the document into jQuery, so

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
we're literally invoking a jQuery function here, and it's going to return something called a rapset.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Now you don't really need to know what that is, but we'll be covering that in the next module on Selectors a

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
little bit more. So we pass in the document, and because this is now a jQuery object, we can now get to the

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
jQuery ready. Now ready is of course defined up in our script. Now what I'm going to do here is say okay,

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
when it's ready what do I want to do? Well, just like we did with window onload we need to give it a

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
function, so we're going to say function, and then we'll go ahead and end our function, and then we need to

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
end the parenthesis here for our ready, so we'll put that in semicolon, and here, I'm going to say alert,

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and we'll say ‘Document loaded' so that we know it's a little bit different from the window load to the

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
document load. Now really what this is, in fact I'm going to change it, it's really DOM has loaded; so not

50
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
all the images have loaded, not all the CSS has loaded, but the DOM, the HTML DOM has loaded, so if we had

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
div down in here, and multiple spans and tables, that's all ready to go, that's how we know that jQuery

52
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
could then be used to manipulate this. Now, another option would be I could just move the script below at

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
the very bottom of --- right before the closing body tag, then I would know that this stuff would be loaded

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
first, then the script would execute, and that would be another alternative.

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But if you want to put it up in the head like we've done here, then you'll want to use the document ready.

56
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Alright, now let's see which one's going to be called for, so window.onload should be called and do an alert

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
here, and then document.ready should be called, and it also should do an alert.

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So let's go back and refresh, and notice that the DOM loaded was called first, now that is correct, because

59
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
it doesn't wait for images and all this other stuff; now you might say, but there are no images; true, but

60
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
in a real web page, odds are you have images and style sheets and other things; this is going to be called

61
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
as the HTML DOM is loaded, and not wait on all that stuff. Then you can see the actual window is loaded.

62
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well now we can use jQuery to do some cool things, so I'm going to give a quick segue into what we'll cover

63
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:45,000
in the next module. So let's say we had an Id down here on a div of "myContent", and inside of here we have

64
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
this My jQuery enabled Page!. So what we can start to learn with jQuery is, instead of doing these simple

65
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
alerts, I'm just going to comment this one out, we can actually come in and start to manipulate things.

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The DOM is loaded, so we can go find things. So I'm going to do our very first selector, and this is going

67
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
to be our hello world to get it out of the way early on. And I'm going to say go find myContent.

68
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Now this is called an Id selector, and we're going to cover this officially in the next module, but for now,

69
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
this will go in and do the equivalent of a document get element by Id; that's what the hash or the pound

70
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
means here. myContent is obviously the Id. Then I want to change the HTML here, so just like with ready

71
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:39,000
off of a jQuery object, we can also do things such as change the HTML, and I'm just going to say ‘Hello World' here.

72
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So now, once jQuery detects that the DOM is loaded, we'll go find our div with the Id of myContent, and

73
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
we're going to change the HTML to Hello World, so let's go ahead and run that, and now, once we run this,

74
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
we'll be off and running with our first little jQuery example, and you can see it worked; we get Hello World.

75
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Now, I'll certainly admit that's not very impressive, but we've got to start somewhere.

76
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So in the next module we'll be talking much more about Selectors and not only Id's but classes, and some

77
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
more complex Selectors, and that's where you're really going to see the power of jQuery.

78
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But at this point you've now seen how to detect when the DOM was loaded through the document ready, and a

79
00:08:24,000 --> 00:59:00,000
simple example of how we can even manipulate the DOM using jQuery.
