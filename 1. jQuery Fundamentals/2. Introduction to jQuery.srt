00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In this first module we're going to talk about some of the reasons you'd want to use jQuery, and some of

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the features it provides out of the box. And then we're going to go into how we actually reference jQuery,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and there's a couple different ways you can do it, you'll see. We can actually load a script locally in a

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
web page, or we can use something called a CDN, or Content Delivery Network, and I'll talk about the pros

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and cons of both approaches. From there we're going to talk about after you have jQuery referenced in a

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
page, how do you actually know when that page is loaded at runtime in the browser so that you can then use

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
jQuery to interact with the page; and it's called the Document Ready, and we'll talk about how that works

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and why you'd need it. And then we'll wrap up with a quick tour of the jQuery documentation out there; it's

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
a very good thing to know, because, although I'll teach you all the key fundamentals you'll need in this

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
course, after you get done there's certainly going to be additional features you might want to add, and you

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
need to know where to go look those up and get more information about them.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So we'll talk about that in the jQuery documentation section. So let's go ahead and get started by talking

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:59:00,000
about why use jQuery, and what are some of the different features it provides.
