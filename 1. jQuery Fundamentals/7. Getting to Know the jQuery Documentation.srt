00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now that you've seen how jQuery can be added into a page and the fundamentals that can be used to get

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
started with it, let's take a little bit of time to run over to the jQuery documentations site.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now this is a site that I have bookmarked, and something that I use constantly in my applications, because

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'd love to say I've memorized every single function that's available, but some of them I just don't use

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that much; some of them I use every day, so it really depends on the application.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I can tell you that if you want to get good at jQuery, you really do need to spend some time getting good at

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
the jQuery documentation. By doing that, you're going to really speed up your productivity, and it's going

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
to be a lot less of a frustrating process. So let's go ahead and head over to jquery.com and take a look at

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
what we can get to as far as docs go.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In addition to getting the script from jquery.com, you can also get to the API Documentation.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'd argue this is one of the most important things you need to know about, especially if you're going to be

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
using jQuery a lot. When I first started jQuery right after it came out, I didn't know a whole lot about

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
the different functions, and luckily they did have some docs back then, and I spent a lot of time in those,

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
because I'd come up with some new thing and it felt like I was climbing up a cliff because I had no idea

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
what to do. Well fortunately, the documentation over the years has gotten better and better, and so let's

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
just take a quick look at what we can get to and what they provide. So you'll notice here on the left, once

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I go to the API docs here, that I have some different categories; so if we want to work with AJAX, which

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
we'll have a whole module on later in the course, or CSS functions, working with Attributes, some of the

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Core functionality, and I can scroll through and get to effects for things like animations and events, and

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
you can see it kind of goes on and on and on, including DOM manipulation.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well, a lot of this stuff will be used in applications. Chances are you're probably going to be

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
manipulating the DOM with jQuery. You're probably going to be making AJAX calls if that's how your

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
application is set up, and if that's how your server is set up. So, we're going to be covering things like

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
events and DOM and all of that in this course, and so you can see that we can just scroll through and get to

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
kind of a vast amount of information, so if we click on Selectors, for instance, which will be the next

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
module of the course, we can see all the different things related to Selectors.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now if we go back to, let's say the DOM manipulation, let's say I want to insert something into the DOM,

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
then you'll notice there's several different methods for doing it; I showed the HTML a little bit earlier

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
in this module, but we can append things, we can pre-pend things, we can change the text, and what's nice

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
about these is once you click on it, find the function you need, you'll get a nice little explanation of it;

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
there's some different options on how you can call these functions, and they'll even tell you when it was

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
added; which version. So if you're using maybe an older version of jQuery for whatever reason, then you'll

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
know what version this particular function or property is supported in.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Now if we come on down, what I really like about it is you can get to some info on how to use these

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
different functions or properties. So in this case, it shows us how we can retrieve HTML content, or if we

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
come on down, you can see how we can actually update HTML or retrieve and use some other functionality; we

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
can even run a live demo here.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So there's a lot of great stuff in here for how to retrieve HTML; this now shows us how we can set the value

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
of HTML, which I demoed a little bit earlier with our Hello World, and we should see down here another

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
example, and there it is. And you can see that they're actually adding a span into the HTML.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And that's the type of documentation that you'll see for most of the different functions and properties

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
available in jQuery. Now, there's certainly some that have less docs, and some have a whole bunch, but in

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
general, this is where you need to go to get started. And it's really going to give you a nice jumpstart if

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
you learn how to navigate this kind of left hand side here. So definitely, I would recommend get good at

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the docs, spend some time in the docs, and it's really going to help your jQuery development process.
