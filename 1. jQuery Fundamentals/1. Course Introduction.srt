00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's no secret that jQuery's one of the most popular JavaScript libraries out there, and for good reason.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You can do an amazing number of things with it, increase your productivity, and quite honestly, have a lot

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
more fun along the way; especially if you have to deal with cross-browser types of issues.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well if you've been wanting to learn jQuery, or have been putting it off and didn't know where to start,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
you're in the right place. I'd like to welcome you to the jQuery Fundamentals course. My name's Dan Wahlin

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
with Pluralsight, and throughout this course I'm going to be covering all the key fundamentals that you need

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
to know to get started on maximizing your productivity with jQuery, dealing with cross-browser issues more

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
effectively, and many other things along the way. With jQuery we can select items in the DOM, we can handle

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
events, we can do AJAX calls, and the list goes on and on and on. And we'll be highlighting and covering

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
some of those key features throughout this course.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now to get the most out of this course, you do need to have a background in JavaScript, so as long as

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
you're comfortable with the overall syntax you'll be fine. You do need a background in HTML and CSS as well.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now, you don't have to be an expert at any of it, but as long as you're comfortable with what an HTML tag

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
is, what CSS is, what a CSS class is and those types of things, then you're getting quite a bit out of this

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
course because jQuery is all about manipulating HTML, CSS, and other aspects of your web page.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So let's go ahead and get started and jump in to module one and talk about why would we want to use jQuery

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:59:00,000
in the first place.
