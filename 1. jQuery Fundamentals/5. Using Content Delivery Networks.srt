1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In addition to loading jQuery from your own server, you can also load it from a Microsoft, Google, or other

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
server, and we call these external servers Content Delivery Networks. Now there's actually several benefits

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
if you want to load your jQuery script from Microsoft, or from Google, or even from the jQuery site.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If you actually go to a site, and let's say you went to say a new site, and they use this URL right here for

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Google; well if you go to that site, that script is now cached for that domain. If you then go to another

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
site that also uses this exact same URL, then the script is already there; it's already cached.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So one of the big benefits of using the CDN is you can get some caching benefits because many of the popular

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
sites out there, instead of hosting jQuery locally, will grab it off a Microsoft or Google site.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now there's a couple other benefits too. Microsoft and Google have datacenters all around the world, so if

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
you're in Australia, odds are you're actually going to be grabbing that jQuery script from a server in

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Australia, instead of having to go wherever your server's located to grab that script.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So you can get some speed benefits there. Number two, you also get something called parallelism; browsers

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
limit the number of simultaneous ACDP calls they can make to a given domain.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So, because this is going to be in a different domain from your actual web server, the browser will allow

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
this to load in addition to whatever you're loading that's local.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So this provides those kind of big benefits: caching, I call it regionality, or closer relationship to the

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
data services out there and servers, and then finally the parallelism of the browser actually being able to

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
load multiple scripts from different domains. Now this is great and at first glance you go, well geeze, how

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
can I lose? You know, I get those three big benefits, and maybe some others, so why would I not want to do this?

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, what happens if, due to the network, or maybe even due to the Content Delivery Network, that you can't

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
get the jQuery script? That would certainly cause a big problem, especially if your app is based on jQuery,

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
because if it can't load that script, you obviously are not going to be able to get to all the cool jQuery

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
functionality that we're going to be covering throughout this course. Well, what you can do in that case is

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
you can provide a fallback, and this is a nice little trick, very simple to do.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can go out to, in this case Google, and we'll try to grab jQuery, and here we would list a specific

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:47,000
version of it, such as 1.9.1, or 2.0.0. Then what we do is if that loads successfully, the Window object

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
in the browser will have a new property off of it called jQuery. Now that happens as the jQuery script

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
actually loads. Now, if the jQuery script can't load, then we're going to have a fallback.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So if the jQuery script loads appropriately, we'll have this jQuery property; otherwise, we'll fall back,

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and we're going to do a document.write, and write out a script tag that points to a local copy of jQuery.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Well now we can have the best of both worlds; we can leverage the caching and the regional servers, and

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
potential parallelism, and stuff like that with the CDN, but for some reason we can't get that CDN script,

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
we can actually just load it locally. And that's an example of working with Content Delivery Networks, and

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
it's definitely something that I recommend you look into, especially in Internet type scenarios.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Now if you're on an intranet app, I'd say it really depends; if the users are all local it probably makes

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
sense actually just to hit a local copy of jQuery off of your server, if you have users distributed all over

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
the place, maybe around the world for instance for your company, then you might want to look at the CDN; it

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
just depends on your network requirements, firewall constraints, and things like that.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So that's some information on how we can use the CDN, and how we can have a nice safe fallback to load a

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:59:00,000
local script if we need it.
