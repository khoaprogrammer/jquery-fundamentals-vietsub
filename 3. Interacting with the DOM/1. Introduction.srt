Hi, I'm Dan Wahlin with Pluralsight. And in this module, we're going to talk about how you can interact with

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the document object module using jQuery APIs. Now up to this point in the course, you've learned how we can

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
use selectors to find nodes in the DOM and we've talked about ID selectors and tag selectors, attributes,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
classes, and stuff like that, and I've even shown maybe 2 or 3 functions that you can use as you interact

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
with selectors and get those notes back, but we're going to take it up a notch in this module and talk about

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
some of the other items, and in some of those that I did cover, we're going to go into a little bit more detail.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So this is a really good module if you want to dynamically influence the DOM, you want to add notes or remove

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
notes, change styles, switch out classes, all those types of things.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So the agenda that we're going to go over here is first off I'm going to start with the each function.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now I've already detailed this a little bit and demoed it in the previous module with selectors.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
However, there's a little bit more you can do with it, and I want to point that out real quick.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Very, very useful function though. From there, we're going to talk about how to modify properties and

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
attributes, and what the difference is there, and it's definitely something you need to know the difference

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
because there's a different syntax you use, a different way you access the object whether you're going

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
directly to the raw object or if you're going in through a jQuery object, so we'll talk about that.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Then we'll get into what I find extremely useful. I do a lot of line of business applications where we'll

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
make calls back to the server with AJAX to get our data as JSON, and then we'll update our page, so we might

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
add notes, we might remove notes, it depends on what the user did of course.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So we'll talk about the different add and remove APIs that are available and it's very, very simple.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If you've used things like document.createElement, you'll know it's quite a bit of code actually if you want

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to add a lot of different HTML nodes or elements into the DOM. Well, with jQuery they've really simplified

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
it and made it super easy to use, so I'll explain that when we get there.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And then finally, we're going to wrap up this module by talking about styles and then we'll talk about classes.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So you've already seen the CSS function a little bit in the Selectors module, but we'll go into a little more

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
detail there, and then we'll go into some really good details if you're a big fan of CSS, and I hope you are,

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
then we'll go into how we can add and remove classes, toggle classes, remove specific classes, all classes,

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
there's all kinds of stuff that's really fun to do to influence how your page looks within the application.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So let's go ahead and jump into the each function and talk about how you can use that in your jQuery apps.
