In this module, we've seen how we can iterate through nodes and modify the DOM in a lot of different ways.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So we started off by talking about the each function and I talked about how you can, as you're iterating through

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the nodes with each, get to the index value and how we can take the raw DOM objects that were fed and wrap

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
those with a jQuery wrapper to do all kinds of other things. I also threw in a couple tips and tricks there

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
for performance that I would definitely recommend you take a look at and consider as you use that each method.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We also talked about how you can modify properties and attributes.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We talked about how if you have a raw DOM object you can get to the properties of that object directly versus

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
if you have a jQuery object you can use the attr function to modify the attributes of that particular element

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
from the DOM. From there we moved on to modifying the DOM using append or prepend functions.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Very easy way to do it, definitely simplifies things as compared to using document.createElement, but keep in

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
mind, you can still use the traditional ways of interacting with the DOM, it's just in most cases jQuery is

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
going to make it easier for you. From there we talked about the wrap function and how we can wrap different

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
children with a parent. It makes it really nice if you want to change for instance the styles or classes

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
associated with that group of items. And we talked about how we can change styles and work with classes and

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
even toggle classes on and off, it makes it really easy to do that as well.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So a lot of good stuff in this chapter, and I hope that'll help jumpstart your jQuery development and your

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:59:00,000
projects.
