1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So let's take a look at an example of how easy it is to work with the four class-specific methods for CSS, so

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
addClass, removeClass, hasClass, toggleClass. So I have some textboxes, input, type equals text, and let's

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
say first off that we'd like to add a highlight class onto those when the page first loads.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So we can come back up top, and you'll notice that I have a highlight class already created for us that just

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
sets the background-color to yellow. Well, what I'd like to do is let's go find all the inputs that are type

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
text, so we can do that with a selector, so let's go ahead and we'll say Class functions.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And we'll go in and say input type equals text, and that'll find all the textboxes for us with our selector,

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and then we can say addClass and we can give it the class Highlight.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And that's all we have to do to take care of that. So we can go in, we can run this, and once it gets to that code

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
you'll see that it automatically highlights both of those and takes care of that for us.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to take out that alert real quick. And likewise maybe we want to remove.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Well, let's go down and let's see what we have here for an ID. We have LastNameTextBox for the ID of this guy.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So, likewise we can come in, we can do, in this case an ID selector, removeClass, and then we can give it Highlight.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now because there's, I believe only one class on here at this point, we could just leave highlight out and it

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
would still work, but let's go ahead and run it as is and you can see now we just have this guy highlighted.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Very nice. Now just to prove the point, let's go ahead and just to remove class and you'll see the same result,

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
but it'll strip off all classes. So if we had RedDiv or BlueDiv plus the Highlight applied, it would strip

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
off everything together. I'll go ahead and put that back for now.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Now you obviously probably wouldn't even want to do this, why highlight it in the first place if you don't

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:37,000
need it. So, what we could do is we could do the hasClass. So we could do LastNameTextBox hasClass Highlight,

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and we can wrap an if statement around that, and then we could change it based on some condition.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Now I'm not going to do that, I'm going to do a little different scenario.

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So I want to make it so that first off we don't highlight it right off the bat.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So I'm going to leave those as comments, but we don't want to highlight that.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Instead what we want to do is when that textbox gets focus, we want to go ahead and set it to yellow with jQuery

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:11,000
or unset it, remove that class. Now again, I could combine addClass, removeClass, and hasClass with all

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
this, but toggleClass is really what this is geared towards. So we haven't gone into how to handle jQuery

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
events yet, so I'm going to handle it the traditional way and put it right into the HTML, but keep in mind

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
that we can certainly do this a different way and that'll be coming up in a different module.

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So I'm going to say onfocus, let's call the Focus function and we'll just pass this particular item, and then

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:50,000
we'll also call onblur and we'll call Blur and we'll pass in this and let's put that on both of these textboxes.

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So we have our onfocus and our onblur, and they're going to call the Focus and the Blur and pass themselves

33
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
into that. Now again, this is the traditional way to do it. There's some other ways you can do this, I'm going

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
to show you in a later module. So let's go ahead and make those functions inside of our script block.

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So we'll make a Focus, we'll just call textbox, and let's do a Blur.

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Now this is going to, when we call this, it's actually going to pass in the DOM object, so we're going to go

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:41,000
ahead and wrap that. And we're going to do toggleClass, Highlight, and then when Blur is called, we're going

38
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
to toggleClass Highlight. Now what that's going to do, and we could, I'm going to change this up to wrap up,

39
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but we could just call the same one, we could call, I don't know, FocusBlur or something, but what we'll do

40
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
is now when they focus, if Highlight is not on that textbox that's passed in, we're going to set it, or vice

41
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
versa, if they Blur and we call toggleClass Highlight now should be on it, because this would have been

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
called first, and we're going to remove it. So let's go ahead and try that out.

43
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So we'll focus, you can see it sets it, we'll change, and you can see it removes it.

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Really, really nice, and makes it super, super easy to work with.

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Now obviously there's some other CSS tricks you could do to work with this type of same scenario, but there's

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
a lot more you can do because now we have full JavaScript. Now let's just go ahead and change this to FocusBlur,

47
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and we'll just use the same exact item here, same function, and so we'll set this to FocusBlur, FocusBlur,

48
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
because now, we really just need the same exact function called, because if it's there, it's going to remove

49
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
it, if it's not there, it's going to add it. So we're going to be able to reuse our code a little bit better,

50
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
refactor it. So we'll go ahead and run it, we'll focus, and you can see we get the same result.

51
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Really easy to work with. So obviously you can make yours look a heck of a lot better than what I have going

52
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
here, the goal of what I'm showing in this lovely screen is mainly just to focus on the concepts, but you

53
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
could certainly take it up to the next level and make it look really nice for your particular forms.

54
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But that's an example of using addClass, removeClass, we could do hasClass, and then toggleClass.

55
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It really simplifies what we'd have to do otherwise and I like the fact that we can still leverage traditional

56
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
JavaScript where we pass in the DOM object, then we put that in a jQuery wrapper so that we can access the

57
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
jQuery APIs. It makes it super easy to work with. So that's an example of how you can work with classes using

58
00:06:48,000 --> 00:59:00,000
jQuery syntax.
