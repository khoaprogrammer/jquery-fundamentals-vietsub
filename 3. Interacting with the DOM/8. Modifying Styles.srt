00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There's going to be times when you want to modify the styles of elements in the DOM, so that's very easy to

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
do and it's actually something we've briefly talked about, but let's officially jump into working with styles.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So, you can jump in and work with the CSS function and it makes it really easy to get the value of a particular

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
item or set the value of a particular item. So in this case you'll notice that we have a div, and on all the

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
divs, since it's a tag selector, we're going to go in and say hey, let's change the font color to red so that

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
any text that's in those divs would automatically have that particular color.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Very, very easy to work with. Now what's nice about the CSS function is it's kind of like the attr function.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You can also go in and you can set multiple values. So we can go in, and in addition to the color, which in

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
this case would set kind of a light gray, ccc, we could also go in and say let's also change the font-weight

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
to bold in this case. Well, this is the JSON object that we talked about earlier.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So, we can come in and we can actually pass CSS a JSON object, just like we can the attr function, and this

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
JSON object starts here, it ends here, and of course it has two properties.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And so you'll notice these properties are quoted, in this particular case you can get away with either

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
non-quoted or quoted for the properties, but it's a little bit different than we saw before.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So that's really nice though when you'd like to set multiple CSS values.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now earlier, I ran a demo where I chained multiple CSS, because mainly I wanted to show how you could chain

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
jQuery functions together. Well, you really don't need to do that, you can just pass the different values

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
you want as a JSON object and you can be done with it, it makes it much easier to work with.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So let's take a look at how we can work with that in our application.
