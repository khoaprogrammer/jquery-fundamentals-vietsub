00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The final thing that we're going to talk about in this module on handling events with jQuery is hover events.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now I've actually shown a couple different ways to do this with shortcut functions and the bind, but there's

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
actually a built in hover that we can use and it makes it really, really easy to handle the mouseenter and

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
mouseout with a minimal amount of code. So let's

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
take a look here at what we can do. So there's a shortcut hover function.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So it's kind of like combining the mouseenter mouseleave functions; you can actually see that here in the second bullet.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So you make your selector and get that all wired up so that it finds the proper DOM element, you then go

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
in and call .hover and then you can give it in this case two functions: one to handle when you hover in

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
or the mouseenter and one for the handler out, which would be equivalent to the mouseleave.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So really simple to do; now there's different versions of this, defend overloads of this functions,

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
so you'll see in a moment there's different functions we can pass for these different parameters.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So the easiest way to use it is to simply call .hover and then pass in those two functions an you'll

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
know that the first function is for when you mouseenter and then mouseleave on that second function.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So in this example you can see that we're simply going in, we're doing a jQuery wrapper in that first

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
function there around this ID selector called target. So we're going to find that DOM object, put it in

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
a jQuery wrapper with this and we're going to simply change the CSS property of background color.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now when they mouseout or when the mouseleave is called officially then we're going to go in, call that

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
second function, and we'll do the same jQuery wrapper and we're going to change the background color it

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
looks like back to white in this example; so very, very simple to do.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Now if all you wanted to do was change one particular style this would be a pretty good way to go,

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
but let's say that you want to swap a class on or off of the DOM element.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well we already know how to do toggle class, I've shown you that actually several times throughout the

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
course, and toggle class combined with hover provides the ultimate in ease of use and flexibility so here's

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
an example of doing that. You can actually just pass in one handler, one function, which is the in and the out.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Now this actually fires when they mouseenter and went they mouseleave and you could certainly detect that

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
with the event object, but the wrapper here around this, you'll see we simply leverage toggle class.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So it really doesn't get any easier than that, you know, you could do this with bind and if you recall

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
with the bind you can pass in a string the function—or sorry, the event names—and so you could pass

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
mouseenter space mouseleave. Well that certainly works and you can go that approach, but you know,

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
with the shortcut here it's like it doesn't get much easier than this.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So we'll call .hover; in this case we're going to do it for paragraph text and we'll simply toggle the

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
over class as they hover in and out of any paragraph class within the page.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So let me show you a quick demo of what that looks like in action and then we'll kind have go from there

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and that'll be the end of this particular module.
