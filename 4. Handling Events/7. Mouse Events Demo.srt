1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The next thing we'll look at now that we've seen the click and the change is some of the mouse shortcuts

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that are available within jQuery to handle events; makes it really, really easy.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So I have just a div down here and let's say that when we interact with that div we want to maybe do something.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We want to update that HTML; we might change the background, something to that nature.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So two things I want to show: number one I'm going to show the shortcut functions, but I also want to

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
show the event object; we haven't really talked about that yet, I'm going to show kind of how that works.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So the first thing I'm going to do is let's go find MyDiv, and then once we've found MyDiv let's go to the

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
different mouse options. So you see we have mousedown, mouseenter, mouseleave, all the way on down to mouseup there.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So quite a bit of functionality built in out of the box. So let's say that when we have mouseenter we'd

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:13,000
like to execute a function. And I'm going to chain onto that; we want to do mouseleave, another function.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And let's go ahead and we'll leverage our highlight class to highlight the background of that particular div.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So the easiest way to do that of course is we can do the toggle class.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now we can certainly do addClass as well but since we want to only add it when they mouse in and out

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
it's a lot easier to go with toggle class; otherwise they'd have to do an addClass here and removeClass here.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Now there's going to be some little code duplication to start but we'll talk about that.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So we're going to do this. and we'll do toggleClass, and then just to get the demo working let's go ahead

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and cut and past that, and definitely we would want to re-factor this—right off the bat that should raise

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
an alarm; we have two kinds of code that are the same. I'm actually going to show you an even better

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
way to do this with less code when we get to the little feature section in this module covering the bind and

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
unbind—really useful. Now we certainly could re-factor this out, let's get it going and then we can do that as well.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So we'll mouseenter, should show it yellow; mouseout show take that yellow off and that's going to

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
highlight this particular div here.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Alright, and there we go; you can see it in action.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Now we might also want to go in; let's say when we mouseover we want to change the cursor, well that will

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
be easy to do, we have the object. We can go to the CSS property or function I should say, and we can

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
say cursor and let's change it to a hand, which is the pointer.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Now that'll automatically change it; you'll see as we mouse in and out we change to a hand to allow the user to click on

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
it whenever they'd like. Now let's go ahead and we may also want to redo some of this.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So let's go ahead just for the sake of showing it so I feel better, let's make a new one called Toggle.

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And this is going to take the object that we're working with, so this—we'll just call it div.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And what we can do is simply take div, whatever it is, and notice if we do div right here .toggleClass

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
we're not going to get any IntelliSense. Let's run that as is; we'll see what happens here.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So we'll pass Toggle and we'll pass this. So at least we have the functionality in one place.

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay, so let's go ahead and run

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
that as is. And you can see it still works.

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So the downside of this is you're not going to get IntelliSense because at this point it doesn't really

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
know it's a jQuery object; now you could certainly come in and what I would do actually in this case is

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
instead of wrapping it here it's probably going to be easier to simply do a wrapper here so that in this

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
case Visual Studio knows about it—now we're back to our IntelliSese and that way we don't double wrap it or

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
something like that. Let's run it one more time and we're still back in business here.

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, so that's an example of using the mouseenter and the mouseleave and it's just as simple for the others.

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Now, a little bit more though I want to wrap up with, and that is we haven't talked about passing the actual

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
event object into any of this stuff. And so as an example when this function is called; there is an event

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
object that's available. In fact I showed that a little bit earlier.

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We went out to the jQuery site and I showed you we can get to things like the current target of the event,

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
the pageX, the pageY, there's a source target—there we go, right there.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And so you can get to all that stuff directly. So let's go ahead and say that also on this div—we're

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,000
going to chain one more here—we'll do a mouseup, we'll pass in a function, but this time I want to just

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
pass an e, you can name an event and call it whatever you want.

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But now we can get to event data about this. And so what's nice is we can go in and let's just change

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:40,000
maybe the HTML of the div; so we already know the div, we've selected it so we could say this, and actually

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
it's not going to—we could just do the text—and we could say e, well let's just do this.

53
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's do X is e.pageX. Now you'll notice you don't get IntelliSense here for the event object so I often

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:05,000
just will run out to the jQuery docs to grab that. And likewise if we wanted, we're really feeling like

55
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
showing everything we can go ahead and do the Y here.

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Alright, let's run that now. And now I can mouse in and out but when I click it actually updates the

57
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
coordinates of where I clicked; you can see as I click around it just continues to update that.

58
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Move up towards the top it gets pretty small on the Y.

59
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Very, very easy to do. Now the other thing you can get to here that's nice is the target.

60
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Now if we just do e.target and run

61
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
you see that it just gives us the actual object of this particular item,

62
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
but remember we talked about the adder function so we could say target, and let's try to grab the ID

63
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
of this and let's see what happens here.

64
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay, now why do we get an error? Hopefully by this point in the course you know.

65
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay, the answer is yes, this is giving us the target, but you notice when—let me run this one more time—

66
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
that it was the raw object—it's the raw DOM object, and the HTML div element.

67
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So if we want to get to the jQuery features we always need to wrap that with a jQuery wrapper.

68
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now we can get to whatever we want; I'm just going to say go to ID in this case using the adder function.

69
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Now let's run it. You'll see we get to MyDiv.

70
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So I've pointed that out a couple times in the different demos, but it's just one of those things to be

71
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
aware of that when jQuery passes you things such as this you're getting the raw object.

72
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
When it passes you the event and you get the target or the current target property then you're getting

73
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
the raw object, so you always need to put it in a jQuery wrapper if you want to get to the jQuery functionality there.

74
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So that's an example of what we can do with the mouseenter, the mouseleave, the mouseup, all that type of

75
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
stuff; very, very easy to do, and you know, what's nice about this is let's say that in addition to this

76
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
guy that as a user mouses over each row we want to go ahead and highlight that as well.

77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Well remember we can always put a comma and now we're going to say on this selector, match my div, and match

78
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
the all tr tags.

79
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So if we run it, it may not be great colors here but you'll see that it highlights all the rows plus our div

80
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and that's just amazingly simple compared to the normal code you typically write if you do this with

81
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
just custom JavaScript; very nice, very easy to work with. So that is a summary on some of the different

82
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
functions that are available; the shortcut event functions and how we can use the mouse events and

83
00:09:06,000 --> 00:59:00,000
actually handle the event object to get to to some of the different data that's available.
