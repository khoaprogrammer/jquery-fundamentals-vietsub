1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's take a look at how we can use the different jQuery shortcut functions to easily attach to an object

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and hook that up to an event handler for events like click and some others.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So I have a form here

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that's just laid out using a really simple table structure; if you like divs, by all means, you can do that too.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Going back to the source, the traditional way we kind of wire up this button here is we come in to the HTML

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and we do onclick = and we give it some functions, so we'll just call this SubmitButton_Click.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And then we come up and add our script block.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And then finally add our function. And let's just put an alert to get it going to start.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay, so that's kind of the traditional way and there's nothing wrong with that, it still works fine,

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
that works cross browser very nicely, and if we go ahead and run this guy

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
you'll see that when we click it we get Clicked Button.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So if that's all we need to do then you could certainly go that route.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now the challenge with this, and I'm kind of anti hooking up events through code now days this way

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
because I like to have one place I can look, so generally I prefer actually to do it through code because

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
then if I want to change things I have one place instead of having to scan a big HTML document.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But there's absolutely nothing wrong with what we just did, it certainly works.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So let me go ahead and take that out and let's do it the jQuery way.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now we'd have two options here if we want to hook to this button and do an event handler for the click,

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
then I could come down into the script block that we used earlier in this module for a demo where I

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
showed kind of the old way of doing it, but let's go ahead, this is a good reason to use the ready function.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So let's go ahead and go back to that. We'll wrap the document object and say .ready and we'll have our function.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, because that way I know everything's loaded, but again you can always do it different ways,

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
but that's a good example where the ready function's available.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now what I like to do is I'll often times have my own custom function in here, I'm just going to call it

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
WireEvents to keep it real simple. And then when I know it's ready I'll simply call WireEvents, and then

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
in WireEvents we can come down and find our SubmitButton and we can go ahead and do an ID selector to get to it.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now we can get into all the different event shortcut functions that are available with jQuery.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So obviously for a button I'd probably want to go ahead and do click, see you notice this takes our handler.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And we could do the same thing as we did before.

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, so that would kind of be the jQuery way, and you know, if you don't like putting the WireEvents

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
like I did you can certainly put this up in the ready as well, but in a real live app what will typically

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
happen is there might be quite a bit of things you wire up and you might sense some CSS dynamically based

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
on the user, so I generally like to break that out into functions to make it easier to maintain.

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So let's go ahead and run that.

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And we'll go ahead and grab Clicked Button.

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now that's not real impressive, let's go ahead and take to the next level instead of saying Clicked Button.

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's go ahead and grab the value from let's say the first name and last name.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So we have FirstNameTextBox and LastName. And let's say that we'd like to just write those right below

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
the button here. In fact I'll do it right to the right of the button in the form.

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So we'll just put a simple div and we'll give it an ID of DivOutput.

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, so we'll come in here and let's go find DivOutput and we can simply do the HTML or text, and I'm

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
just going to go ahead and update the text and keep it simple in this example.

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And now we need to grab our text boxes, so what I'm going to do to kind of make it easier to read is we'll

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
just say var value = and we'll grab our FirstNameTextBox and we're going to grab val.

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We talked about that briefly in one of the previous modules in a demo, but that's the easy way to with

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
jQuery get the value of that when an event has happened and you're dealing with form input controls.

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And we can come in and do LastNameTextBox; do the same thing. And let's call this—actually I meant to call

48
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:29,000
that first name—and lastNameVal; keep it simple.

49
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay, so pretty standard code, all jQuery though. We have the ready function that fires that calls

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
WireEvents; WireEvents is now going to wire up programmatically to our click button so we're going to

51
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
keep it out of the markup in this case and do it programmatically.

52
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
When that gets called we'll go ahead and go into here, grab that FirstName and LastName value and then

53
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
concatenate them together. It should update that div down there at the bottom.

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So let's go ahead and run this.

55
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And let's just do John Doe. And you can see it outputs it like you would expect.

56
00:06:05,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Now that's just the first example of using the click.
