1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Up to this point you've seen how we can handle events using the shortcut functions like mouseenter,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
mouseleave, mouseup, and I chain those together and it works out really well.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well behind the scenes these are actually delegating to on; in fact, I'm going to show

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
a nice source code viewer here that'll help you see

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
exactly what the jQuery functions do. So if I go type in jquery source viewer

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
this will take me off to the jQuery source viewer home here.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And now I could switch to the latest version of jQuery. And as I type click this will let me see the

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
actual source code that jQuery runs behind the scenes. You'll notice it's actually delegating to on.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now we could even navigate if you want to see all the details for on.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now likewise if I wanted to look at the focus, it's also going to on; in fact, all of these are.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We can do the mouseenter and notice it's also going to on. So really

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
on is the core event handler function that's behind the scenes. So what I'm going to do to demonstrate

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
it is let's come on in and tweak this a little bit, so I'm going to comment this code out that we had before.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And let's look at using bind and on. Now bind is the original version that we had prior to jQuery 1.7.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So if you are in an earlier version because you're kind of stuck there for now then you're going to have

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
to go with bind if it's prior 1.7. But 1.7 or greater you can actually go with our on.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And so now I can come in and do the following: we can go find the same thing as we did up here and so

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
we'll find MyDiv, and then I could do bind if I want and then give it the events.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So we could say mouseenter, mouseleave, and the last one up here is mouseup.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now we're going to be able to handle all three of those and that's all you would do with bind.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now to change this to the modern way to do it you simply change that to on, so not a big surprise there.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Now when these events are fired what are we going to do? Well we need a function so we're going to handle

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
the function and pass an event arc here. And that'll represent our event object that gets raised.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So when mouseenter, mouseleave, or mouseup are fired we're going to come in and do something with those.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So I'm going to get to the div that was actually triggered here and we'll say toggleClass and I'm going to

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
toggle a class we had up earlier called highlights, so just as a quick review it just changes the background to yellow.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And so we're going to use the built in jQuery toggleClass to either add the class or remove the class

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
based on the presence or lack of presence. So we'll go ahead and do highlight there.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now I'm also going to go in and change—we're just going to use CSS for this one but I could certainly

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
do it through a class. And I'm going to change the cursor—let's put that in quotes actually.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Now I could certainly go in to the highlight and change that, but in this case I'm saying I always want

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
it to be there. I generally prefer to use classes but this will get the job done.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now I want to do something really special in this case—if its mouseenter or mouseleave this is all I want

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
done, but if it's a mouseup I want to do what we did earlier and grab this text right here and write out

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
pageX and the pageY location. So we'll come in here and put that but I only want to do it if it's a mouseup.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So we could say if (e.type == ‘mouseup') and that'll let us know that it's just this one event, then we'll

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
come in and we could handle the mouseup and we're going to write the text of the div and update it to

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
the pageX and the pageY; in other words, where'd you click with the mouse?

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And that's all we have to do to actually go in and use the on. Now if at any point I wanted to come in

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and turn things off then we would do the same thing; we could say MyDiv or we could even cash that in

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
a variable since we've already selected it and say off and then if we wanted to turn, for instance,

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
mouseup off we would just do that and mouseup would be off. Now If I just put off it would turn off

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
everything in this case. So I'm going to go ahead and just leave that commented out here.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So now if we run this what'll happen

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
is I can now mouseover the MyDiv and it should automatically change it,

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and then if we click in it when the up actually fires for it then we'll be able to see that and write out

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
the different pageX and pageY.

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Alright, so there we go; so there's the hover affect that we had earlier, so nothing really impressive,

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
we're just using the on right now and then if I click it notice that it now writes out the X:73 Y:22

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and wherever I click it'll update it of course.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And now we're able to handle all of that in one simple location using the on.

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Now you can certainly use the shortcut functions if you'd like; it's an alternative—it's really up to you

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
on what you'd prefer. I do think the shortcut functions are nice in the sense that I don't have to

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
type any quotes, but in this case I prefer the on because now I can actually go in and handle multiple

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
events as you see. So that's an example of the role of on and as I mentioned, you could change this

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
to bind as well and it would still work but that would only be prior to jQuery 1.7.

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:59:00,000
The modern way to do it is to use the on.
