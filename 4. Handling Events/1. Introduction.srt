00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If you're working a lot with JavaScript in the browser then odds are you probably have to handle different

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
types of events. After all, you need to know when the user clicks on a button or when they select a

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
different item from a drop-down, or maybe you even want to know when they mouseover a div or something along those lines.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well if you've done it before by hand and had to deal with cross-browser issues you know it can be a little

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
more challenging than you would think, at least at first glance.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And that's because depending on how far back you need to go in the browsers as far as the support goes,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
it can get a little challenging because the older browsers, especially Internet Explorer, didn't support

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the standard at the time. And the newer browsers do so now you'd have to write some code to figure out

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
which one to do and we'll be talking about that more coming up.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So what we're going to talk about in this module is how jQuery really simplifies handling events,

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and not only does it make it easy but it provides a very robust API; and you can handle different types

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
of events in different ways and we'll talk about several of those ways as we move along here.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So the agenda is we're going to start off by talking about some of the cross browser issues out here

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and the challenges that provides us as developers, and then from there we're going to jump right into

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
jQuery and talk about so what are some of the shortcut functions it has that allow you to handle events.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We'll talk about some of the new on and off type of functions that can be used for binding two events

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
in a really dynamic way. And then we're going to talk about how events can bubble up and how we can handle

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
those and provide some efficiencies, especially when it comes to working with a lot of children in a table

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
or maybe a bunch of children in a div or things like that. So we're going to talk about the live,

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
delegate, and on functions, and I'll introduce live and delegate—they're a little bit older—mainly so you

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
know about them in case you come across them on a blog post or something like that, but we'll mainly

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
focus on the new and preferred API, and that is the on and the off.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And then we'll wrap up by talking about different techniques you can use in jQuery to do hover effects.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So if you've ever handled it by hand with an event you know that you can do things like mouseenter and

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
mouseleave, and you can do that in jQuery as well and I'll show that.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But there's some built-in things that make it really nice to not only detect the events but also to swap

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
out styles, swap out CSS classes and things like that. So let's go ahead and jump in and get started

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:59:00,000
by talking about how jQuery simplifies the process of working with events.
