00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In a previous demo in this module I showed how you can use the bind function to wire up multiple events

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
with a single statement to a particular callback function. So we did that with the bind, you can see that

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
example right here; so we bound in this case the mouseenter, the mouseleave, and the mouseup to this particular function.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So you could certainly do that to handle the equivalent of a hover and it's really the same thing,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
or I could even use the shortcut functions mouseenter mouseleave and they would work as well.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But if we really want to make it super easy to work with then we can handle the hover shortcut and use that.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So let's go ahead and what I'm going to do is we're going to add a selector ultimately and then do .hover,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but let me show you what we want to select.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So we have this simple form we've been working with, which just has two columns in it to represent our

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
labels and our controls. And so let's say that when they hover over these particular rows we want to put

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
a kind of a light gray background on it; alright. So we can do that by simply doing the hover and making two functions.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So coming on back up to the JavaScript let's go ahead and first let me show you the tables.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So you can see the table is MyTable and then we have trs. Now that's the only trs in this particular page

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
so we can just say tr if we want, but of course it's always faster from a performance standpoint with a

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
selector to give it a starting point so we're going to go ahead and say go find MyTable and then go get

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
the trs within that. And now we'll say hover. Now from here we simply pass in either one function,

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
which I'm going to do in a moment or the two representing each type of function.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So let me wrap these down so we can see them clearly; so this first one would represent the mouseenter equivalent.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And we'll do one more. And this will represent our mouseleave.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So let's say that we just want to put that kind of light gray background on it, so we can just simply take

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
the object that was passed to us at this point, which would be this, go to our CSS and say let's change

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
the background color and we'd like to change that to kind of a light gray here.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And when they mouseout or call the equivalent of that, which is mouseleave, we'll go back to a white

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
background in this particular example. Alright, so let's go ahead and try that out

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and you should see as we hover over the different rows it'll automatically highlight them and it's a

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
really subtle highlight but its there. So you can see that now when they're in this it makes it really

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
easy to kind of keep track of where you're at. Now in this example, you know, this is not so much a data

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
type table, but you could certainly use this for when you have the equivalent of an Excel spreadsheet as

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
an example and it makes it really nice to highlight that row that they're working on.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Alright; now while that particular code works fine it's quite a bit more code than I might want to do

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
unless you know, maybe I want to change just some individual styles—the cursor or something like that,

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
then this would be fine. But if we move up top to our CSS area I have this light highlight and this is

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
a little bit darker gray to make it a little easier to see, and what I'd like to do is show you the ease ire

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
way to do this. So we can come back down and instead of doing this way let's go ahead and comment that out.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Let's add a comment here: Using hover. And then we'll come on into here and we're basically going to do

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
the same thing, so we're going to come in, we'll find MyTable tr and we'll hover, but we're going to do

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
a single function this time. Much easier, because now all I have to do as shown earlier, is we can come

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:20,000
in and wrap this and toggleClass and we can pass in that LightHighlight class.

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now this is going to do the exact same thing—it'll be a little bit darker than this gray.

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's go ahead and try it out. So you can see now that as we highlight that it highlights those different

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
rows really easily here. So super, super

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
easy to implement. And you know, you have the flexibility of handling the unique mouseenter and the

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
unique mouseout, or if you just want to kind of treat it, let it do its thing, and use toggleClass this is

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
probably the easiest way to do it, so at this point I've shown you how you can use the shortcut functions;

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
mouseenter, mouseleave; I've shown you how you could use bind—that was shown up here, and then finally

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
we just looked at how you can use hover. So there's three and there's even more than that I'm sure I can

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
think of another way, but different ways to work with this. I think the flexibility there is one of the

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
strengths of jQuery—yeah, sometimes it's a little difficult to know, so which is the better way?

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Well in my opinion this is the best way if you want to do a simple hover, because I prefer to use CSS classes

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
you know, whenever I can; it makes it nice and easy. Alright, now to end this video let me go and and show

51
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
you one more little shortcut function that's kind of related. I'm going to come and comment this guy out.

52
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We're going to grab this code, and I'm going to do something that's similar here.

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Alright, so let me comment this back in. Scoot that over a little bit.

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hover is obviously the mouseenter, mouseleave, but there's also another one called toggle.

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And that'll call other functions as well; in fact, you can have more than one function with a toggle.

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So every time you click it, it could do something different—click, click, click, click, click.

57
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So if I run this, now notice as I mouseover nothing happens here, but now I'm going to click on the row

58
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and you can see that it highlights it, when I click it again it turns it off.

59
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Now I don't know that that's real applicable to rows per say, but while we were at it I wanted to show

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
how it really is using the same exact code, it's just now it toggles it based on when we click so first

61
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
time we click this gets applied, second time we click that gets applied, and then let me do a third to

62
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
show you how this works.

63
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And I'm just going to type in the name yellow here and make it kind of obvious.

64
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So now as I go in, and keep in mind this could, you know, probably be on a div or maybe a row of column

65
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
or data, but I'll click, we'll click again, and we'll click again, and so you can see every function you

66
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
put it toggles through those different options.

67
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Very nice when you need it. So that's just kind of a bonus one that looks like hover, but you know,

68
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
it's a little bit different there. So that's an end to our section on handling events in jQuery, and

69
00:07:19,000 --> 00:59:00,000
specifically on how we can handle the hover, and then there's your quick look at the toggle shortcut.
