00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this module we talked about how jQuery can be used to really simplify our life when it comes to

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
handling events in a cross browser way. So we talked about how in Internet Explorer IE8 really and earlier

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
they handle events and attach to events quite a bit differently than all the other browsers.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
IE9 gets it right and makes it much easier but there's still going to be IE8 and earlier hanging around.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So jQuery takes all that out of the picture. It provides several shortcut functions; we talked about

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
some of them such as click, dblclick, mouseenter, mouseleave, and more.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And provides functions such as bind, which is more of a low level API that allows you to pass in one or

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
more event names that you want to bind to a particular DOM element that we found with a selector.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What's nice about bind is you simply separate those event names with a space and it automatically

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
will call the function that you define as either—either of them if there's two, or if there's more, any of

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
them I guess—are triggered. Unbind we also talked about can be used to clear events or strip those off

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
of a given DOM object. You can, if you pass no parameters, it strips everything or you can pass specific

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
event names to just remove those. From there we went into the live and the delegate and these two

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
were used to allow future children added into the DOM programmatically to automatically be associated with

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
an event and an event function. The difference was live was in jQuery 1.3 and it bubbles events from

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
those children up to the document object, which ultimately handles triggering the event and calling the

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
event handler I should say. The delegate goes in and it actually allows you to supply a selector context

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
so instead of having to bubble everything up all the way to the document object, which could be expensive

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
depending on how deep your events are going, delegate allows this selector context so that it only bubbles

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
up to that specific parent—hopefully that's just one or two levels up from these children that are

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
ultimately leading to the event firing. So those are really, really nice though if you want to just hook

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
things up once, and as I showed with the phone demo, allow different phones to be added as they click and

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
not have to always add additional code to wire those new text boxes or whatever it may be off to an event function.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The final thing we talked about was the hover and I showed how hover is really just a shortcut function,

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
but it simplifies the mouseenter mouseleave and provides a really simple way to really to either pass it

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
two functions representing both the mouseenter and mouseleave or one function and then you can combine

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
that with things like toggleClass, so jQuery really provides a lot of simplicity and ease of use when it

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
comes to events, and it even makes it easy to work with the event object, which we also talked about

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and get to some of those properties cross browser. So one of the things I've been mentioning throughout

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
the course, I would recommend that if you get some time head off to jquery.com and check out the events

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
section because there's even more in there that wasn't covered here; this is a kind of introduction to

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
it to get you started and the more you know the more powerful you are as a developer, so I would

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:59:00,000
definitely take the time to go explore what's there so that you know what's available.
