1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now that we've seen the click let's go ahead and add a little bit more.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Maybe when they select a different value from our select here, our dropdown, we might want to do something

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
specific when that particular event fires. Now again, doing it the kind of normal way we could come in

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and say onchange, but we're going to go ahead and do it the jQuery way.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So in the WireEvents I'm going to come in and we'll say Handle select and we'll go ahead and go and find

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that for our states.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So let me go ahead and I'm going to change this ID to StatesSelect—make it a little more obvious.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Alright, so when we come in, you know, of course we don't want to do a click on this—wouldn't make much

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
sense—but we can come in and we can do a change. Now the change does the same type of thing.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We can have event data that's passed in or if we don't need it we can just go ahead and handle it directly.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Now I'm just going to go ahead and handle it directly with no event object.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And there we have our change. Now when the change fires what do we want to do with it?

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So what we want to do is obviously grab the value of our select and work with that.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now, the easiest way to get that is when the change is fired then I'll be passed in also the object that changed.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And so we can actually come in and say this and we can grab a val.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So let's go ahead and we'll just pop that up in an alert just to see it in action.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And let's run it.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And you can see we get the value that was clicked, so very nice and very easy.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I didn't have to worry about getting the selected index or anything fancy; you can see I could just get

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
directly to that object without having to, you know, retype that ID and look it up again in the DOM.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now here's an interesting thing though with change; it actually works not just on selects in jQuery,

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
it actually works with input controls or text blocks.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And so we can come in—or text areas I should say—we could come in and let's come on to here and let's just

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
add a kind of a bogus class here. I'm just going to call this MyInput.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And I'm going to go ahead and put that on two of these. I'm also going to put it on the select.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to demonstrate the concept here. So we now have MyInput on a text box, a text area, and a select.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And so coming back up what we can do now is instead of saying only find this ID we could do a class

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
selector on MyInput. Now whatever changes will get the val.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Now watch what happens here, this is pretty cool,

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and something that you just out of the box can't really do with JavaScript.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So let's go ahead and take that off and I'm just going to mouseout and you can see the value—there is no value.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We're going to go to John—I'm now going to mouseout, now I didn't put it on that one so it shouldn't do

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
anything; see it doesn't. Doe, now this one should trigger it; it did.

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And then This is my comment, mouseout. So you can see that the change actually can be used much like we

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,000
would do with a key press down or key press up, or focus or loss focus; it makes it really easy to work with this.

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Plus, it also works with the select. Now I don't know about you but I find that pretty cool because it

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
makes it really easy if there is a scenario where I need to know multiple things are changing because

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I might change a style or whatever it may be.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
As an example let's say that we do have a style up here; well actually let's just reuse our highlight—

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
that's what I was just going to do, forgot that was up there.

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So let's come in; instead of just alerting the value—we can do that too—but let's go ahead to that element

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and we can do addClass, Highlight, which will set the background color.

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So now once they've filled out particular aspects of the form—the first one doesn't have it so it won't'

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:54,000
do anything—Doe; now once it shows the alert it's going to highlight what they've changed in the document.

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And you can see it's now highlighting everything; now you may or may not want that behavior or that particular

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
color, but you can see what can be done very, very easily using jQuery and the change function.
