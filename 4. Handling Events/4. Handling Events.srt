00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's take a look at what jQuery offers us out of the box when it comes to handling events in a cross

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
browser way so that you're not pulling your hair out worrying about which browser works and which doesn't

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
for the different attachments.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So there are a lot of different shortcuts that are built in to jQuery that automatically hide from you

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the cross browser issues that were mentioned in the previous section.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So here's just a few of them: click, blur, focus, you'll notice there's even a dblclick, which is a little

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
trickier to do in JavaScript without—you'd have to set up interval times and things.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But different mouse events and key events and all that type of stuff, and what you can do with these

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
is find your object using the selector, simply hit .click, .blur, whatever it is based on the object

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and then have a callback function; very, very simple. So you can get a lot of details about this at the

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
URL below: api.jquery.com, so let me go ahead and pull up the browser and show you what's at that site.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So the event documentation for jQuery is actually really good.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
A lot of details, all the API functions are called—or covered I should say—and there's even demos with most of them.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So if I scroll on down you'll notice that we have this bind, we're going to talk about that a little bit

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
later—that's not a shortcut function, that's actually what the shortcut function's called behind the scenes.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But here's blur, change, click, dblclick; we'll talk about some of these others later—delegate, and die,

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and live, but in addition to the shortcut functions there's also this event object so you'll notice that

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
you can get to different properties of the event, such as if you want to know the pageX and pageY—the mouse

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
position relative to the document. Then what they've done is the event object that's passed when you

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
use one of the shortcut functions—such as mousedown or mouseup—will automatically pass you an event

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
object that's wrapped with jQuery wrapper and automatically gets you into the appropriate property

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
based upon the target browser. Now, the event object itself is even different across the different browsers, or can be.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So that's a nice thing. So if you want to get to the target for instance, there's only one way to do

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
that if you go through jQuery so you don't have to worry about the hassle of doing it on your own.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So here's where you can get to the different API's; now I'm not going to have time to cover every single

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
one of these but let's do a real quick demo of say dblclick.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So if you go in to dblclick you'll notice that you have to give it a handler, and the handler, which is the

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
callback will allow an event object to be passed in. And then scrolling on down here's how we use it,

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
it's very simple. So we grab the target, in this case in other words the DOM object wrapped with a jQuery wrapper.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We call dblclick and here's our callback. Now we could pass an event object right into here if we wanted,

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
but in this case we're just going to pop up an alert. So at the bottom of this we have a little better

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
example where we have a particular DOM element we're going to find and then we're going to attach the

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
dblclick function to it and have it our callback. Now you'll notice when it's dblclicked on the target

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
we're going to go ahead and toggle the class called dbls. We're going to switch it back and forth between

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
different items so here's dbl actually, which is a yellow background.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So I'm going to come down, we'll dblclick it, you'll see it change to yellow, I'll dblclick again,

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
that'll take that class off into the toggle and we're back to where we were.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So that's an example of the documentation, and with the events it's really nice because there's just a lot

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
of these shortcuts that you probably won't have memorized of course, that's where you can go to look.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So now that we've seen a few of the shortcuts and how you can get more documentation about them let's

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
look at a quick example here.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So the click is one of the more common ones, and as shown even with the dblclick its are very similar.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You have a handler and that handler can even have an event object passed if you'd like.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Well, in this example we're going to go find an ID selector so we're going to go find myID, whatever that

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
is, attach our click to it, identify our callback function, and then in this case we're just going to pop up an alert.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So nothing real fancy on this particular example. Another example that is shown

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:34,000
here, and so you'll notice that we call click, but in this case we target some other objects click.

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So you can actually trigger events, there is a trigger function actually, or in this case if we just want

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
to trigger in essence the click event, then we're going to say hey, when this one is clicked we're also

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
going to cause this one to be clicked. So click in other words is not just for receiving the data,

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
but you can actually trigger these events on other objects if that fits your particular application.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So it makes it very easy to work with that way. So let's take a look at using some of these shortcut

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:59:00,000
functions in an application web page.
