1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
To this point, we've looked at how we can select different nodes out of the DOM by tag name, by ID or even by

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
style class name, but there may be times when it's not enough just to find it by class name or by tag name,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
or even by ID, you actually want to go in, check a specific attribute for a value, and then find that based

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
upon the value. So that's what we're going to learn about here is how we can start to combine a little more

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
sophisticated syntax in our jQuery selectors. So, it's very easy to

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
work with. In fact, if you've ever worked with something called XPath, which has been around for a long time

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
with XSLT and some XML technologies, it uses a very similar syntax in its language.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So what we're going to learn here is instead of just saying hey, let's go find all the anchor tags, what if

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
we want to go say go find me an anchor tag that has a title attribute on that anchor tag.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, we can do that with the following syntax. So again, jQuery object, call into the selector function,

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
we're going to pass in the tag that we want, but we're going to say where the anchor tag has a title attribute.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now notice it doesn't say where title is equal to something or has a starts with or ends with value, it just

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
says has a title. Now you can also go in though if you wanted to search for a very specific title, you could

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
come in and say yeah, go find the anchor tag where, and every time I see these brackets here, I think in my

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:37,000
mind where, the title attribute equals ProgrammingInfo. Now yes this is JavaScript, and normally you can do

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the double equals for comparison, but in this case we don't, it's a very specific syntax that you have to use

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
with jQuery, so we just use a single equals here. So this is actually a really, really useful selector because

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
there's oftentimes where for instance you might have a lot of different divs that have specific text that you

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
know to look for. So you might have states as an example and you want to find all the divs that have the value

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
AZ as the value of the text as an example. Well, you could do that very easily using this syntax.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So again, before we run into the demo, think anytime you see the anchor or the div or whatever the tag is, if

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
you see square brackets next to it, think where whatever it is.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Now this one only shows title, but if for instance we had input type equals text, for a textbox, then you

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
could go highlight all textboxes. Now there's other ways you can do that as well, but that would be an example

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:59:00,000
of what you can do out of the box with this particular functionality.
