00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Our webpage has two different divs, and these divs have some classes applied to them.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So we have Blue div and a Red div and each in turn, you can see the syntax Visual Studio shows here has div.BlueDiv

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and div.RedDiv, and actually that looks very much like the jQuery selector syntax.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So what I'm going to do is we're going to come into our source and find those divs, they're right here, and

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
you can see the class names on them. So if we wanted to go in and find all the blue divs, then all we'd have to

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
do is apply that class selector syntax. So we'd just simply come in, put the dot, which represents a class

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
name, say BlueDiv, and then let's say we want to change the CSS style on that div.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So this isn't modifying the class, but it is going in and actually adding a style.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So let's say we want to change the border to 2 pixels solid red border around that.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So what that'll do is go on in, find that div, and any div that matches that class, and in this case we're going

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
to go ahead and apply that border, and you can see it works. Now I said find that div, and that's actually

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
not entirely accurate. If we come back, this doesn't care if it's a div or a span or whatever it may be, we

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
can come down and let's just add in a span to demonstrate the concept, and we'll do BlueDiv and just put This

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,000
is my blue span. Let's go ahead and run that now. And because my selector didn't say what to find, you'll

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
notice it also highlighted the second span, the second class that's applied within the webpage.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So, not only is it very easy to do, but it could highlight some things you don't want necessarily, so you've

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
got to kind of know what you're doing and what you want to select.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now to make this really efficient, let's say that, let's come back and I'm actually going to put that back in.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And let's say we only want to target the div, we don't want to find everything that has BlueDiv.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So well, as I showed you before, we'll come in and say div.BlueDiv, and now only the div will be highlighted

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
with that particular style. You'll notice the span here doesn't have that particular style associated with

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
it, so we're doing what we want here. Likewise, we could come on in and do the span, and what that'll do is

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
as you'd expect, ignores the div because now we're being very specific in what the selector is doing.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So, that's how easy it is to work with selectors using class names, something that's very powerful, but as

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I've mentioned a few times in this section, be really careful with it because it is going to scan the whole

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
DOM when you just do things like this, so very nice. Now the final thing to wrap up, I also showed that you

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:03,000
can do multiples of these. So we can put a comma and we could say RedDiv, and if we scroll on down, so for BlueDiv

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
we have this and of course we have our span that has BlueDiv, but we also have another div with RedDiv applied.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So this will now apply that border, the red border, which you probably won't be able to see too good in the

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
RedDiv, because it's already red, but it'll apply that border around all three of those now, and so yeah, you

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
can't really see it on the red because it's red on red, but very nice, very easy to work with, especially

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
compared to doing this by hand where you'd go in, you'd have to loop through all these DOM elements and all

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
that and what's really nice is if we just wanted to target the divs, we could also prefix both of those and

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
say only focus on divs that have those class names. Now when we run it, you'll see that the span is left alone.

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So that's an example of using class name selectors with jQuery.
