00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So back in Visual Studio, I have my document ready function and you'll notice if I scroll on down that we

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
have a couple different tags in here, we have a form tag with an ID, and that's about it, we don't have a whole

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
lot going on as far as IDs right now. So let's go ahead and add in just right here at the top, let's go ahead

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and add in a div since forms aren't real exciting at this point, and we'll just call this TestDiv.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And inside of that we might have, This is my div text. So if we want to find that particular div, TestDiv,

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
all we'd have to do is once we know the DOM is loaded, we can come on in, we'll start with our jQuery selector,

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and we have to do the pound, or the hash, and do the name of it, TestDiv.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And then we can come in and let's say we want to, well let's grab the HTML and we'll actually write that to

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
an alert. So HTML again is a jQuery function, and we'll just update that in an alert box.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So let's pop that up and you'll see This is my div text, you can see that it found it.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now this is by far the fastest way if you're going to be using selectors in jQuery, it's by far the fastest

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
way to find your different DOM elements. If I do something like we did in the previous module, or section I

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
should say, and just do a p tag, well that's going to scan the entire DOM and find all of the paragraph tags.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So, by doing the ID, it knows exactly what to look for and it's optimized in the document object model to be

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
able to find that. So that's all you have to do to find those particular items.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We could come down to wrap up this section and come to form1, put that in there, and that should return for

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the form all this table HTML. So let's go ahead and run that, and you can see it did.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We have some stuff that was injected, but here is our table tag that was added into the DOM, which represents

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
our form down here. So that's how easy it is to use ID selectors.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The nice thing is, as shown in the previous section, in addition again, the HTML, I could certainly modify

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
styles, I could change classes, I could even add children if I wanted, all programatically and it's very,

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
very compact, and I just think it's a lot more easy to work with, it's a lot easier to work with I should say

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
than getElementById, and then we put in TestDiv, which is the traditional way to do it.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So, kind of take your pick there, but you get a lot of benefits by getting the jQuery object instead.
