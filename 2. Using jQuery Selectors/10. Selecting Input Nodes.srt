00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Next up in our tour of jQuery selectors is selecting input nodes, very useful if you're working with forms,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
textboxes, textareas, selects, those types of things where the end user can input data into your application.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So there's a new character syntax that you haven't seen up to this point that can be used in a lot of different

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
ways, but one of the ways is with input elements, and you'll notice that if you look up at the top here, we

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
have our jQuery selector function, and we're going to not just pass in input, which as we just covered in the

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
previous section would only select the input tags, we want to actually select all input tags.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now you might say well what else is there. Well keep in mind that things like textarea and select don't have

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
an input tag of course, that is the tag, textarea and select. Well the :input is different from the standard

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
input in that :input selects all of those things, inputs, selects, textareas, buttons, even images, radio

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
buttons and those types of things, checkboxes. So you can get the whole picture of things that can be on a

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
form that are used to input data and click on buttons and things.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now, this will return all of those elements. So that means if you wanted to get radio buttons, you could

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
just do this, you could say :input, but we want to filter it by the type of input and say the type is radio.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Now that is going to target all radio buttons, but is that the most efficient way to do it based on what we've

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
covered up to this point in the module. And the answer is no, it's not, because this is going to select all

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
of the things that qualify as an input, input, select, textarea, button, all those types of things, and as a

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
result, you're going to have to filter through more things to find where the type is radio versus if you just

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
went in and took out the colon and put input, now we're only going to filter based on just the input tags.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So we'd say grab the input where the type is radio. So it's a very subtle difference, but you've got to keep

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
in mind that anytime you do a selector, it's going to grab this whole set, which in this case is the set of

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
input, and then it's going to go ahead and filter based upon the type of radio.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So you need to be careful of that so you can make your app as efficient and performant as possible.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So let's take a look at how we can use input tags though, and it's very useful any time you just want to quickly

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:59:00,000
iterate through different items in a form, including textareas and selects and things.
