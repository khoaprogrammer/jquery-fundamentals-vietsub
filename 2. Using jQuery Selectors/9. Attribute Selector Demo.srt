1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So let's take a look at how we can actually apply what you've just seen with attribute selectors into our

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
page and actually select some things. So we're going to come in and do our normal jQuery selector.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now if I just went in and did div, we know that would just find all the divs, but I want to go in and say find me

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
all the divs where there's a title attribute first off, like you saw earlier.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So let's go ahead and we'll wrap an alert around that so we can see the length.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And right now you'll notice I have a div here with a title, and that should be the only one I have in the page.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So let's go ahead and run that as is and you'll notice that we get, there's one available, which is correct.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Alright, so now that we've done that, let's take it up one notch and let's go find a specific one.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's add on this div a title as well, we'll just say Contains Table.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So now we don't want to just find the div where there's a title because that's going to return both of them,

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:19,000
but we want the specific div that has Div Title. Now at first glance you may look at this and say why would

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
you do that because if you know it's Div Title, this div has an ID.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well let's just assume that maybe there's a couple divs that have that same title, and we want to find all of

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
those divs, we don't know the ID necessarily. So we search for Div Title and it does match the exact type of

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:47,000
string, and let's just go ahead and put that in a divs collection and we'll do an alert on, let's do divs,

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
yeah, we'll just do length again, and run that. And so what's going to happen now is you'll see we just find the 1.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And let me change this up a little bit though. Let's change the case of the div to be a different case than

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
what you see here and run this now and let's see what happens. You can see it is case sensitive, so that's

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
definitely something you'll have to watch out for, it's definitely something I've been bitten with personally

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
when I wasn't paying attention and not really worrying about the uppercase or lowercase version of it.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So out of the box you'll need to know about that, but that makes it really nice.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Now that just finds divs with titles. Let's go in and find any input tag that we might have, and we could just

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
do input tag, but let's say I want to find an input tag that type is text.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Now if we scroll down to the bottom of the form, you'll notice I have a couple of those.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I have one right there and one right there with type as text. And so now we'll say go find all the input tags

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
where the type of the input tag, the attribute, has a value of text.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And I believe we'll get two of those back unless I have some others I'm not thinking about.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So yeah, we get two of those back now you can see, and that matches up with that selector.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And what's nice about this is this isn't divs anymore, it's inputs I guess.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And now based on the little bit of syntax I've shown you, this is a jQuery object, so now it has full access

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
to the jQuery API and so we could do things like I showed earlier, and maybe we want to change the background-

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,000
color to say yellow of those particular inputs. So let's go ahead and run it and you'll see that we've now

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
changed our textboxes to be yellow and it was super easy to work with.

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So that's an example of using ID selectors. Now at the end of this module, I'm going to have even more because

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
you may want to find where it starts with text or ends with text or it just contains the word text.

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Right now it has to be an equivalent match, it has to match character for character, and as I showed you, the

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
case matters. There's some other more flexible things we can do though and at the end of this module, I'll

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
run into that as well, but that is an introduction to using selectors in jQuery, and it's something that I

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
use actually a fair amount, very useful to know about, and something you'll definitely be applying as you

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:59:00,000
work with jQuery more.
