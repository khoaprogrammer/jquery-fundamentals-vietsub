00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The fastest type of selector you can do with jQuery is what's called an ID selector.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oftentimes in your HTML page you'll go in and you'll give IDs, identifiers, to your specific tags to make it

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
easy to find, and that's pretty common, been around for a long, long time.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And normally you'd use document.getelementbyid to find those specific IDs.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well, in jQuery it's even more compact than that. What we can do is we'll, just like we learned with the tag

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
selectors in the previous exercise in the previous part, you come in and use the jQuery object, so the dollar,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
call into the selector function, and you put the name of your ID.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So what we have here down at the bottom is we have a paragraph tag with an id of myID, but if we just put myID

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
in here as we just learned, it would look for a myID tag, and that's obviously not what we want, we want to

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
select it based upon the ID. So what this will do is if you put the hash, or the numeric-type symbol, then

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
it'll automatically go in and know to look for something that's an ID, and that's kind of jQuery's way of

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
knowing that you don't just want to tag, you want a specific ID, and you've got to remember, especially if

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
you're new to this, to put that in front or it's not going to work right.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So let's take a look at an example of using an ID selector and how easy it is to work with those.
