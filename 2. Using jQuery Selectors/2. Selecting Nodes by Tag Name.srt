00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If you've ever needed to select a specific tag out of your page as it loads, then you can do that with

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
document.getelementsbytagname using regular JavaScript. And that works cross-browser, there's not

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
really a problem there at all. A little bit long in my opinion, but it still works.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, in jQuery you can do the same thing, but it's actually much more compact and I think it's just plain

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
easier, and that's what we're going to cover in this section.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So here's an example of selecting the paragraph and the anchor tags using a jQuery selector.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So you'll notice that we start with the jQuery object, we put the dollar, we then call into a function, and

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
we pass in the selector syntax, which in this case is simply the name of the tag or element that you want to call.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now what this will do is go up into the DOM, it'll look for all the tags that are paragraph or anchor tags,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and return those back. So this one up top here would return a collection of paragraph tags, this one will

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
return a collection of anchor tags. So very, very simple and definitely more compact than the longer

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
document.getelementsbytagname. In addition to that, what if we wanted to select not only the paragraph tags,

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
but also all the anchor tags, but in just one statement, we want to merge those into one collection.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well we can do that as well, we just simply do a comma separated list of the tag names.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So in this example here, we're going to again start with the jQuery object, call into the function for the

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
selector, and pass in that we want to select the paragraph, the anchor, and the span tags.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Now it's going to return all of those in one single collection, and then you could loop through those, you

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
could apply styles, you could do all kinds of stuff once you get that collection back, very simple to work with.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Now, you can even go in and instead of just saying find me all these specific tags, what if you just want to

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
go in and find specific tr tags that are nested directly within a table tag for instance.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, you can combine that as well using the ancestor descendant syntax, which will go in and select the

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
table tag, and then you'll notice that we put a space, and a space then will separate the descendant that

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
we'd like to select. So in this example we'd say, go find the table, but specifically don't return the table

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
tag, just return all of the tr tags that are descendants of that particular ancestor, that particular parent.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So that'll go in it and grab those tr tags and allow you to manipulate the children and go even deeper if you'd like.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So let's take a look at an example of using selectors and show you how easy it is to work with.
