00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
AJAX is one of the most important features introduced into browsers over the past 10 years, in my opinion.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It allows us as developers to integrate a variety of data into our applications and make it so we don't have

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
to reload the page every time a user clicks on something or blinks for the most part.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And so in this module, we're going to talk about the AJAX features available in jQuery, how we can use those

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to get data from a server and integrate it back into our page using some of the features we've already talked

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
about in jQuery. And we've talked about how to manipulate the DOM and how to handle events and use selectors

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to find DOM elements. So we're going to tie all that together and start working with some data that we're

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
going to retrieve remotely. So the agenda for this particular module is we're going to start off by talking

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
about the core features available in jQuery when it comes to AJAX, and specifically we'll focus on some of

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the functions that are there. From there, we'll talk about how we can get HTML data easily into an application.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And this is really useful actually. You may just want to load help content as a user clicks on something, or

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
you might want to actually load parts of a page, but instead of just returning say JSON data or XML, you're

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
actually just going to return HTML that the server renders and then update the DOM with that HTML.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We'll also talk about how we can make GET and then POST requests.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And so GET requests are just, you do this every day when you type the link into the browser and hit Enter.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That would be a GET request, or any time you load a script using the source attribute of the script tag, that's

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
a GET request to the server. We'll talk about that, and then we'll also talk about post, which allows us to

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
send more data to the server. So post is similar, but different way it works behind the scenes.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And then we'll introduce finally the AJAX function. Now the ones I just mentioned we're going to talk about

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
that allow us to load and get and post and those types of things, really they rely on, there's a kind of underlying

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
function called AJAX that gives you all the power. It's the most low level API for AJAX, it gives you the

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
most flexibility, but it does require a little bit more coding to use.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I actually prefer AJAX in general and I usually will write wrapper functions around it because it gives me

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
the ultimate in flexibility. So we'll talk about all those and then you can choose which one you'd like to

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:59:00,000
use in your application when you want to exchange data back and forth between a browser and the server.
