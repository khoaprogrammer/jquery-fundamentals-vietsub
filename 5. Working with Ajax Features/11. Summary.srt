00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this module, we've talked about a lot of the different features available in jQuery that make it easy to

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
work with AJAX. Specifically, we focused on a few key of the key functions available such as load, get,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
getJSON, post, and AJAX, and I've showed you how those can be integrated into your jQuery applications.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Load, as we talked about, allows you to load HTML content from a server, and very easily assign that HTML

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
into a given selected DOM node. So you simply give it a selector, call .load, and then give it the URI, URL,

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
whatever you want to call it, and it'll go out and grab that. We also talked about the get.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now get provides a little more flexibility because it doesn't do just HTML, it can also do JSON and HTML and

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
XML. And then we talked about getJSON, which of course is a GET request, but specific to retrieving JavaScript

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
object notation data. We also talked about a little bit of a difference between get and post, and I showed

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
how post really is the same API as get, it's just that it executes a post request to the server.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And then finally, I showed how ajax is the core, the low level API function that's available in jQuery that

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
really all of the others tie into and use. So the sky is the limit when it comes to working with AJAX and jQuery

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
because you can work with all kinds of different data, the cross-browser issues aren't issues because that's

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
abstracted out from us, and it's just really easy to get going and actually I think kind of a pleasure to

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:59:00,000
work with, it makes it fun to exchange data and to add those cool features into your web applications.
